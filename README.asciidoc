== Introduction

Celos is a tool for running recurring workflows that process data in
Hadoop, such as MapReduce programs or Hive SQL scripts.

image::etc/images/celos-ui.png[Celos UI]

The above screenshot shows the Celos UI.  Each row represents a
workflow.  The tiles are called slots and are individual executions of
a workflow for a particular point in time.  Most workflows in the
screenshot are hourly, and some are daily.  Green slots have already
run.  Slots in `wait` are still waiting for their preconditions (such
as data availability in HDFS) to be met.  `rdy` are ready to run, and
will be scheduled in one of the next scheduler steps.  `run` slots are
currently running.  `time` slots have timed out after waiting too long
for their preconditions to be met.  `fail` slots have failed, and have
no more retries left, so they need to be manually rerun, if desired.

Celos workflows are defined with JavaScript.  An example is here:
link:samples/quickstart/src/main/celos/workflow.js[].  On each
scheduler step (which is usually triggered once a minute from cron),
Celos evaluates all workflow JavaScript files, and then schedules the
workflows they define.  Celos keeps a database recording the state of
each slot as small JSON file.

Celos works as frontend to link:https://oozie.apache.org/[Apache
Oozie], which is the actual execution engine for workflows.  Oozie
provides a small XML-based DSL for describing the actions a workflow
should perform (example:
link:samples/quickstart/src/main/oozie/workflow.xml[]), and
distributes the jobs across the cluster.

== Prerequisites

* JDK 1.8
* link:https://hadoop.apache.org/[Apache Hadoop] 2.5.0
* link:https://oozie.apache.org/[Apache Oozie] 4.1.0

You can probably get away with slightly older Hadoop and Oozie
versions.

== Getting Started

Head over to link:samples/quickstart[*samples/quickstart*].

== JavaScript API Reference
=== General
==== celos.defineWorkflow

This is the main API call that registers a new workflow.  Any number
of `celos.defineWorkflow` calls may appear in a file.  See
link:samples/quickstart/src/main/celos/workflow.js[] for a file that
defines two workflows.

`celos.defineWorkflow` takes as argument an object with the following
fields:

* id: The identifier string for the workflow, must be unique.
* trigger: The link:#triggers[trigger] that determines data availability for the workflow.
* schedule: The link:#schedules[schedule] that determines the points in time at which the workflow should run.
* schedulingStrategy: The link:#scheduling-strategies[scheduling strategy] that determines when and in which order ready slots should be run.
* externalService: The link:#external-services[external service], actually responsible for executing the job.

==== celos.importDefaults

Evaluates a file from the defaults directory in the current scope, so
all variables and functions from the file become available in the
current file.

Example:

[source,javascript]
....
celos.importDefaults("foo");
....

=== Triggers

==== celos.hdfsCheckTrigger
==== celos.successTrigger
==== celos.andTrigger
==== celos.orTrigger
==== celos.notTrigger
==== celos.offsetTrigger
==== celos.delayTrigger
==== celos.alwaysTrigger
=== Schedules
==== celos.cronSchedule
==== celos.hourlySchedule
==== celos.minutelySchedule
==== celos.dependentSchedule
=== Scheduling Strategies
==== celos.serialSchedulingStrategy
=== External Services
==== celos.oozieExternalService
=== Variables
==== CELOS_DEFAULT_HDFS
==== CELOS_DEFAULT_OOZIE
==== CELOS_DEFAULT_OOZIE_PROPERTIES

== Command Reference

=== celos-server.jar

The celos-server.jar launches Celos.

==== Server command-line arguments

===== --port

This required argument sets the HTTP port under which the server will run.

===== --workflows

This optional argument sets the workflows directory from which Celos
reads workflow JavaScript files.

If unsupplied, defaults to /etc/celos/workflows.

===== --defaults

This optional argument sets the defaults directory which contains
defaults JavaScript files that can be imported by workflows.

If unsupplied, defaults to /etc/celos/defaults.

===== --logs

This optional argument sets the directory which contains the log
files.

If unsupplied, defaults to /var/log/celos.

===== --db

This optional argument sets the directory which contains Celos' state
database.

If unsupplied, defaults to /var/lib/celos.

===== --autoSchedule

This optional argument sets the interval (in seconds) after which
Celos should automatically start a scheduler step.

In unsupplied, Celos will not automatically schedule, and wait for
POSTs to the /scheduler servlet instead.

==== Server servlets

===== /scheduler

POSTing to this servlet initiates a scheduler step.

In production we do this once a minute from cron.

===== /workflow-list

GETting this servlet returns the list of workflows loaded into Celos.

===== /workflow-slots

GETting this servlet returns information about a workflow and a subset
of its slots.

===== /rerun

POSTing to this servlet instructs Celos to mark a slot for rerun.

=== celos-ci.jar
==== CI command-line arguments
===== --mode
===== --deployDir
===== --hdfsRoot
===== --target
==== CI environment variables
===== CELOS_CI_USERNAME
==== Target files
=== celos-ui.jar
==== UI command-line arguments
===== --port
===== --celos
===== --hue
==== UI servlets
===== /ui
