_The Celos UI_

=== Oozie Overview

Celos works in conjunction with the
link:https://oozie.apache.org/[_Apache Oozie_] execution engine, so
we'll quickly describe Oozie before diving into Celos proper.

Oozie provides services such as distribution of jobs across a
cluster, log aggregation, and command-line and Web UI tools for
inspecting running jobs.

To run a job in Oozie it is packaged into a workflow directory and put
into HDFS, as the following diagram shows:

image::etc/images/oozie.png[Oozie workflow directory]

Oozie requires a small XML file that describes what the job should do
(in this case call a Java main with some arguments), and then runs it
on a processing node in the cluster.  Artefacts in the `lib` directory
are automatically placed on the classpath.  Arguments (such as
`inputPath` and `outputPath` in the above example) can be passed to
the job.

Oozie XML files support
link:https://oozie.apache.org/docs/4.2.0/WorkflowFunctionalSpec.html[many
different kinds of actions] besides calling Java, such as manipulating
HDFS, loading data into databases, or sending emails.  This is mostly
out of scope for this document, but in general, Celos workflows can
use all features of Oozie.

You can view all currently running jobs in the Oozie Web UI, _Hue_:

image::etc/images/hue-index.png[Hue index]

You can also view details of a particular job in Hue:

image::etc/images/hue-details.png[Hue details]

=== Celos Concepts

==== Workflows

If we have the Oozie workflow directory to run in HDFS at
`/wordcount`, hourly input data in `/input/YYYY-MM-DD/HH00`, and want
to write output data to `/output/YYYY-MM-DD/HH00`, we can set up a
simple Celos workflow with the ID `wordcount` like this:

[source,javascript]
....
celos.defineWorkflow({
    "id": "wordcount",
    "schedule": celos.hourlySchedule(),
    "schedulingStrategy": celos.serialSchedulingStrategy(),
    "trigger": celos.hdfsCheckTrigger("/input/${year}-${month}-${day}/${hour}00/_READY"),
    "externalService": celos.oozieExternalService({
        "oozie.wf.application.path": "/wordcount/workflow.xml",
        "inputPath": "/input/${year}-${month}-${day}/${hour}00/",
        "outputPath": "/output/${year}-${month}-${day}/${hour}00/",
    })
});
....

A Celos workflow always has an Oozie workflow
(`/wordcount/workflow.xml` in this case) as its "meat".

If we were to receive data from two sources, say two datacenters in
`/input/nyc` and `/input/lax`, we can define a helper function and use
that to quickly define two workflows with the IDs `wordcount-nyc` and
`wordcount-lax`:

[source,javascript]
....
function defineWordCountWorkflow(dc) {
    celos.defineWorkflow({
        "id": "wordcount-" + dc,
        "schedule": celos.hourlySchedule(),
        "schedulingStrategy": celos.serialSchedulingStrategy(),
        "trigger": celos.hdfsCheckTrigger("/input/" + dc + "/${year}-${month}-${day}/${hour}00/_READY"),
        "externalService": celos.oozieExternalService({
            "oozie.wf.application.path": "/wordcount/workflow.xml",
            "inputPath": "/input/" + dc + "/${year}-${month}-${day}/${hour}00/",
            "outputPath": "/output/" + dc + "/${year}-${month}-${day}/${hour}00/",
        })
    });
}
defineWordCountWorkflow("nyc");
defineWordCountWorkflow("lax");
....

Here's an overview over schedules, triggers, and scheduling
strategies, described below:

image::etc/images/slots.png[Celos concepts]

==== Schedules

Each workflow has a schedule that determines the points in time
(called _slots_) at which the workflow should run.

Celos supports `cron`-like schedules with <<celos.cronSchedule>>:

[source,javascript]
....
// A workflow using this schedule will run every hour.
celos.cronSchedule("0 0 * * * ?");
// A workflow using this schedule will run every day at midnight.
celos.cronSchedule("0 0 0 * * ?");
// A workflow using this schedule will run every day at 5am.
celos.cronSchedule("0 0 5 * * ?");
....

Another type of schedule is <<celos.dependentSchedule>>, which makes a
workflow use the same schedule as another workflow.  This is useful
for setting up a downstream workflow that tracks an upstream workflow,
without having to duplicate the schedule definition.

==== Triggers

For each slot of a workflow, a trigger is used to determine whether
it's ready to run, or needs to wait.

===== Simple Triggers

Let's look at some commonly used simple triggers.

<<celos.hdfsCheckTrigger>> waits for a file or directory in HDFS:

[source,javascript]
....
// A slot at time T will wait for the file /logs/YYYY-MM-DD/HH00/_READY in HDFS.
celos.hdfsCheckTrigger("/logs/${year}-${month}-${day}/${hour}00/_READY");
....

<<celos.successTrigger>> waits for the success of another workflow,
allowing the definition of dependencies among workflows:

[source,javascript]
....
// A slot at time T will wait until the slot at time T of 
// the workflow with the ID "workflow-foo" is successful.
celos.successTrigger("workflow-foo")
....

<<celos.delayTrigger>> waits until the current wallclock time is a
given number of seconds after the slot's time:

[source,javascript]
....
// A slot at time T will wait until the current time is one hour after T.
celos.delayTrigger(60 * 60)
....

<<celos.offsetTrigger>> lets us offset another trigger a given number
of seconds into the future or past.

[source,javascript]
....
// A slot at time T will wait until the _next hour's_ file is available in HDFS.
celos.offsetTrigger(60 * 60, celos.hdfsCheckTrigger("/logs/${year}-${month}-${day}/${hour}00/_READY"));
....

===== Combined Triggers

We can also combine triggers with <<celos.andTrigger>>,	<<celos.orTrigger>>, and <<celos.notTrigger>>:

[source,javascript]
....
// A slot at time T will wait until both /input-a/YYYY-MM-DD/HH00/_READY
// and /input-b/YYYY-MM-DD/HH00/_READY is in HDFS.
celos.andTrigger(celos.hdfsCheckTrigger("/input-a/${year}-${month}-${day}/${hour}00/_READY"),
                 celos.hdfsCheckTrigger("/input-b/${year}-${month}-${day}/${hour}00/_READY"));
....

[source,javascript]
....
// A slot at time T will wait until the current hour's file, the next hour's file,
// and the file for the hour after that are in HDFS.
var hdfsCheck = celos.hdfsCheckTrigger("/logs/${year}-${month}-${day}/${hour}00/_READY");
celos.andTrigger(hdfsCheck,
                 celos.offsetTrigger(60 * 60 * 1, hdfsCheck),
                 celos.offsetTrigger(60 * 60 * 2, hdfsCheck));
....

[source,javascript]
....
// A slot at time T will be ready if, after one hour, the slot at time T
// of the other workflow "workflow-bar" is _not_ successful.
// This can be used to send an alert for example.
celos.andTrigger(celos.delayTrigger(60 * 60),
                 celos.notTrigger(celos.successTrigger("workflow-bar"));
....

This last trigger should be used in conjunction with a
<<celos.dependentSchedule,`celos.dependentSchedule("workflow-bar")`>>.

==== Scheduling Strategies

A workflow's scheduling strategy determines when and in which order
the ready slots of the workflow should be run.

There's only one scheduling strategy at the moment,
<<celos.serialSchedulingStrategy>>, which executes ready slots oldest
first, with a configurable concurrency level.

[source,javascript]
....
// A workflow using this scheduling strategy will run three slots in parallel.
celos.serialSchedulingStrategy(3);
....

=== How it Works

The main data sources Celos uses are:

==== Workflows Directory

The workflows directory contains JavaScript files that define workflows.

It may look like this:

....
workflows/
  wordcount.js
  some-other-workflow.js
  yet-another-workflow.js
....

==== State Database

The state database directory contains the state of each slot as a
small JSON file.

....
db/
  state/
    wordcount-lax/
      2015-09-15/
        00:00:00.000Z
        01:00:00.000Z
        02:00:00.000Z
        ...
    wordcount-nyc/
      2015-09-15/
        00:00:00.000Z
        01:00:00.000Z
        02:00:00.000Z
        ...
....

An individual slot file in the state database,
e.g. `db/state/wordcount-lax/2015-09-15/01:00:00.000Z`, looks like
this:

....
{
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "externalID": "0008681-150911205802478-oozie-oozi-W",
  "retryCount": 0
}
....

The `status` field records the state the slot is in.

The `externalID` field contains the Oozie ID of the corresponding
Oozie workflow execution if the slot is running, successful, or failed
(otherwise it's null).

The `retryCount` records how many times the slot has already been
retried after failure.

==== Scheduler Step

On each scheduler step (typically triggered once per minute from
`cron`), Celos evaluates all JavaScript files in the workflows
directory, yielding a set of uniquely identified workflows.

Then, for each workflow, Celos fetches all slot files within a sliding
window of 7 days before the current date from the state database.

Each slot is a state machine with the following states:

image::etc/images/states.png[Slot states]

Celos takes the following action, depending on the state of the slot:

[options="header"]
|===
|State|Action
|WAITING|Call the workflow's trigger to determine whether the slot is ready.  If the trigger signals readiness, put the slot into the READY state.  If the slot has been waiting for too long, put the slot into the WAIT_TIMEOUT state.  Otherwise, keep the slot in the WAITING state.
|READY|Pass the slot as a candidate for scheduling to the workflow's scheduling strategy.  If the strategy chooses to execute the slot, submit it to Oozie, and put it into the RUNNING state.  Otherwise, keep the slot in the READY state.
|RUNNING|Ask Oozie for the status of the execution.  If the slot is still executing, keep it in the RUNNING state.    If the slot has succeeded, put it into the SUCCESS state.  If the slot has failed, but there are retries left, put the slot into the WAITING state again.  If the slot has failed, and there are no more retries left, put the slot into the FAILURE state.
|SUCCESS|Do nothing.
|FAILURE|Do nothing.
|WAIT_TIMEOUT|Do nothing.
|KILLED|Do nothing.
|===

The state database contains additional information about slots that
have been manually rerun with the <<rerun>> HTTP API.

In the following example, the slots `2015-08-01T01:00Z` and
`2015-08-01T02:00Z` of the workflow `wordcount-nyc` have been rerun.
They are outside the sliding window, so the above scheduling algorithm
would not look at the slots.

However, rerunning a slot touches an additional file in the `rerun`
subdirectory of the state database, and slots for which such a file
exists are fed into the scheduling algorithm in addition to the slots
from the 7 day sliding window.

....
db/
  state/
    ... as above ...
  rerun/
    wordcount-nyc/
      2015-08-01/
        01:00:00.000Z
        02:00:00.000Z
....

Rerunning thus serves two purposes: besides the main use of rerunning
a slot, it can also be used to _backfill_ data, by using it to mark
slots outside the sliding window that the scheduler should care about.

==== Further Directories

Celos has a *defaults directory* that contains JavaScript files that
can be imported into a workflow JavaScript file with
<<celos.importDefaults>>.  Such defaults files are used for sharing
global variables and utility functions.

Celos writes daily-rotating logs to a *logs directory*.

All directories (workflows, defaults, logs, and database) are
configurable via <<Server Command-Line Arguments>>.

=== Continuous Delivery of Workflows

Changing a workflow definition in Celos is as simple as updating the
workflow JavaScript file and/or the Oozie workflow definition in HDFS.
On the next scheduler step, Celos will pick up the changes.

Bundled with Celos comes a tool called Celos CI (see <<Celos CI Reference>> 
as well as link:samples/quickstart[]) that automates this
process, and can be used in conjunction with GitHub and a CI server
such as link:https://jenkins-ci.org/[Jenkins] for continuous delivery
of Celos workflows.

For each group of related workflows, we have a GitHub repository and a
Jenkins job that deploys the workflows on push to master using Celos
CI.  Celos CI copies the JavaScript files to the Celos host with SFTP,
and uploads the Oozie workflow directory to HDFS.

=== Experience

As of September 2015, Celos has been in use at
link:http://www.collective.com[Collective] for about two years, and is
currently running all of our Hadoop processing (hundreds of individual
workflows across dozens of projects).

Celos is productively used by people from different backgrounds, such
as data science, operations, software engineering, and database
administration, and has proven to be a welcome improvement on our
previous Oozie coordinator-based scheduling.

We're proud that in two years of use, not a single bug in Celos has
caused any downtime, which is attributable to the small codebase
(about 2500 non-blank, non-comment lines of code for core Celos, as
measured by link:http://cloc.sourceforge.net/[cloc] 1.56) and the
rigorous test suite (hundreds of unit tests and an extensive
integration test).

=== External Services Reference

An external service actually executes a workflow.

==== celos.oozieExternalService

===== Description

Executes slots with Oozie.

===== Syntax

[source,javascript]
....
celos.oozieExternalService(properties, oozieURL?)

|`oozieURL`|String|No|The HTTP URL of the Oozie API.  If not specified, the value of the <<CELOS_DEFAULT_OOZIE>> variable will be used.
|===

Inside property values, the variables `${year}`, `${month}`, `${day}`,
`${hour}`, `${minute}`, and `${second}`, will be replaced by the
zero-padded values from the slot's scheduled time.

`year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, and `second` will also be
set as Oozie properties, so they can be used in the Oozie workflow XML
file.

Additionally, Celos will set the Oozie property `celosWorkflowName` to
a string like "my-workflow@2015-09-12T20:00Z", useful for display.

`oozie.wf.application.path` is the only property required by Oozie.
It points to a
link:https://oozie.apache.org/docs/4.2.0/WorkflowFunctionalSpec.html[Oozie
workflow XML file] within an Oozie workflow directory.  There can be
multiple XML files within a single Oozie workflow directory.

If <<CELOS_DEFAULT_OOZIE_PROPERTIES>> is defined and an Object, its
members are added (before other properties, so they can be overridden)
to the Oozie properties.

===== Examples

[source,javascript]
....
celos.oozieExternalService({
    "oozie.wf.application.path": "/workflow-dir/workflow.xml",
    "prop1": "Hello. It is the year ${year}!",
    "prop2": "Just another property."
});
....

=== Variables

If defined, these global variables influence some API functions.  It's
a good idea to set them in a common defaults file imported by all
workflows.

==== CELOS_DEFAULT_HDFS

The String value of this variable will be used as the default HDFS
name node URI by <<celos.hdfsCheckTrigger>>.

==== CELOS_DEFAULT_OOZIE

The String value of this variable will be used as the default Oozie
API URL by <<celos.oozieExternalService>>.

==== CELOS_DEFAULT_OOZIE_PROPERTIES

The members of this Object will be added (before other properties, so
they can be overridden) to the Oozie properties of a workflow by
<<celos.oozieExternalService>>.

== Celos Server Reference

The celos-server.jar launches Celos.

The celos-server.jar must be run in the following way, due to the need
to put the Hadoop configuration on the classpath:

[source,shell]
....
java -cp celos-server.jar:/etc/hadoop/conf com.collective.celos.server.Main <arguments...>
....

=== Server Command-Line Arguments

[options="header"]
|===
|Name|Type|Required|Description
|`--port`|Integer|Yes|HTTP port for server.

|`--db`|Path|No|State database directory (defaults to /var/lib/celos/db).
|`--autoSchedule`|Integer|No|Interval (in seconds) between scheduler steps.  If not supplied, Celos will not automatically step the scheduler, and wait for POSTs to the /scheduler servlet instead.
|===

=== Server HTTP API

==== /scheduler

Doing a POST to this servlet initiates a scheduler step.

In production we do this once a minute from `cron`.

===== Example

[source,shell]
....
curl -X POST localhost:1234/scheduler
....

==== /workflow-list

Doing a GET to this servlet returns the list of workflows loaded into Celos.

===== Example

[source,shell]

curl "localhost:1234/workflow-list"
....

prints:

....
{
  "ids" : [ "workflow-1", "workflow-2", "workflow-3" ]
}
....

==== /workflow-slots

Doing a GET to this servlet returns the slots of a workflow within a
time range.

It also returns other information about the workflow, such as its
paused state (see the <<pause>> servlet).

    "status" : "SUCCESS",
    "externalID" : "0004806-150911205802478-oozie-oozi-W",
    "retryCount" : 0
  }, {
    "time" : "2015-09-13T13:40:00.000Z",
    "status" : "SUCCESS",
    "externalID" : "0004804-150911205802478-oozie-oozi-W",
    "retryCount" : 0
  },
  ...
  ]
}
....

==== /trigger-status

Doing a GET to this servlet returns human-readable information about
why a slot is waiting.

|===

===== Example

[source,shell]
....
curl "localhost:1234/trigger-status?id=workflow-1&time=2015-09-13T13:00Z"
....

prints:

....
{
  "type" : "AndTrigger",
  "ready" : false,
  "description" : "Not all nested triggers are ready",
  "subStatuses" : [ {
    "type" : "DelayTrigger",
    "ready" : false,
    "description" : "Delayed until 2015-09-14T16:00:00.000Z",
    "subStatuses" : [ ]
  }, {
    "type" : "HDFSCheckTrigger",
    "ready" : true,
    "description" : "HDFS path hdfs://nameservice1/logs/dc3/2015-09-14/1500 is ready",
    "subStatuses" : [ ]
  } ]
}
....

==== /rerun

Doing a POST to this servlet instructs Celos to mark a slot for rerun.

The slot's state will be reset to waiting and its retry count will be
reset to 0.

===== Parameters

[options="header"]
|===
|Name|Type|Required|Description
|`id`|String|Yes|ID of the workflow.
|`time`|String (ISO 8601, UTC)|Yes|Scheduled time of slot to rerun.
|===

===== Example

[source,shell]
....
curl -X POST "localhost:1234/rerun?id=workflow-1&time=2015-09-13T13:40Z"
....

==== /kill

Doing a POST to this servlet marks a slot as killed and also kills its
underlying Oozie job, if any.

===== Parameters

[options="header"]
|===
|Name|Type|Required|Description
|`id`|String|Yes|ID of the workflow.
|`time`|String (ISO 8601, UTC)|Yes|Scheduled time of slot to kill.
|===

===== Example

[source,shell]
....
curl -X POST "localhost:1234/kill?id=workflow-1&time=2015-09-13T13:40Z"
....

==== /pause

Doing a POST to this servlet pauses or unpauses a workflow.  While a
workflow is paused, the scheduler will simply ignore it.  This means
it doesn't check any triggers for the workflow, doesn't submit new
jobs to the workflow's external service, and doesn't perform any other
action related to the workflow.

You can check whether a workflow is paused by looking at the `paused`
field of the result of the <<workflow-slots>> servlet.

===== Parameters

[options="header"]
|===
|Name|Type|Required|Description
|`id`|String|Yes|ID of the workflow.
|`paused`|Boolean|Yes|Whether to pause (`true`) or unpause (`false`) the workflow.
|===

===== Example

[source,shell]
....
# Pause a workflow
curl -X POST "localhost:1234/pause?id=workflow-1&paused=true"
# Unpause a workflow
curl -X POST "localhost:1234/pause?id=workflow-1&paused=false"
....

== Celos CI Reference

The celos-ci-fat.jar can be used to deploy workflow and defaults
JavaScript files, as well as Oozie workflow directories automatically.

[source,shell]
....
java -jar celos-ci-fat.jar <arguments...>
....

=== CI Command-Line Arguments

[options="header"]
|===
|Name|Type|Required|Description
|`--mode`|String|Yes|`deploy` or `undeploy`
|`--workflowName`|String|Yes|Name of workflow (or rather, project).
|`--deployDir`|Path|Yes|The deployment directory (not needed for `undeploy`).
|`--target`|URL|Yes|The target file (file: or sftp: URL).
|`--hdfsRoot`|Path|No|HDFS data will be placed under this root (defaults to /user/celos/app).
|===

=== Deployment Directory

A deployment directory must follow a canonical directory layout:

....
workflow.js
defaults.js
hdfs/
  workflow.xml
  ...
  lib/
    ...
....

* `workflow.js` is the JavaScript file containing workflow definitions.
* `defaults.js` is a JavaScript defaults file containing variables and utility functions.
* `hdfs` is the Oozie workflow directory.

If `WORKFLOW_NAME` is the value of the `--workflowName` argument, and
`HDFS_ROOT` is the value of the `--hdfsRoot` argument, and
`WORKFLOWS_DIR` and `DEFAULTS_DIR` are the Celos workflows and
defaults directories specified in the target file, respectively, then
the files will be deployed to the following locations:

....
workflow.js -> $WORKFLOWS_DIR/$WORKFLOW_NAME.js
defaults.js -> $DEFAULTS_DIR/$WORKFLOW_NAME.js
hdfs/       -> $HDFS_ROOT/$WORKFLOW_NAME
....

=== Target File

A target file is a JSON file that describes a Celos and HDFS setup.

[options="header"]
|===
|Name|Type|Required|Description
|`hadoop.hdfs-site.xml`|URL|Yes|URL of Hadoop hdfs-site.xml File
|`hadoop.core-site.xml`|URL|Yes|URL of Hadoop core-site.xml File
|`defaults.dir.uri`|URL|Yes|URL of Celos defaults directory.
|`workflows.dir.uri`|URL|Yes|URL of Celos workflows directory.
|===

All fields must be file: or sftp: URLs.

Example:

[source,json]
....
{
    "hadoop.hdfs-site.xml": "sftp://celos002.ewr004.collective-media.net/etc/hadoop/conf/hdfs-site.xml",
    "hadoop.core-site.xml": "sftp://celos002.ewr004.collective-media.net/etc/hadoop/conf/core-site.xml",
    "defaults.dir.uri": "sftp://celos002.ewr004.collective-media.net/etc/celos/defaults",
    "workflows.dir.uri": "sftp://celos002.ewr004.collective-media.net/etc/celos/workflows",
}
....

The best practice for using Celos CI is putting a target file for each
Celos installation (e.g. production and staging) in a central,
SFTP-accessible location, and storing the target file's SFTP URL in an
environment variable (e.g. `PRODUCTION_TARGET` and `STAGING_TARGET`).
Deploy scripts using Celos CI should then pass this variable as the
`--target` argument to Celos CI, making them independent of the Celos
installation to which the workflow is to be deployed.  See
link:samples/quickstart[] for an example.

=== CI Environment Variables

==== CELOS_CI_USERNAME

If defined, overrides the username in sftp: URLs in the target file.

== Celos UI Reference

The celos-ui.jar runs the Celos user interface.

[source,shell]
....
java -jar celos-ui.jar <arguments...>
....

=== UI Command-Line Arguments

[options="header"]
|===
|Name|Type|Required|Description
|`--port`|Integer|Yes|HTTP port for UI.
|`--celos`|URL|Yes|Celos URL.
|`--hue`|URL|No|Hue (Oozie UI) URL.  If specified, slots become linked to Hue.
|`--config`|Path|No|JSON <<UI Config File>>.
|===

=== UI Config File

If the `--config` argument is not supplied to the UI, it simply
renders one long list of all loaded workflows.

By supplying a JSON file with the following format to `--config`, the
workflows can be hierarchically grouped (one level):

[source,javascript]
....
{
  "groups":
  [
    { 
      "name": "Group 1",
      "workflows":
      [
        "workflow-1",
        "workflow-2"
      ]
    },
    { 
      "name": "Group 2",
      "workflows":
      [
        "workflow-3"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
....

=== UI HTTP API

==== /ui

Doing a GET to this servlet displays the Celos UI.

===== Parameters

[options="header"]
|===
|Name|Type|Required|Description
|`time`|String (ISO 8601, UTC)|No|Time of most recent slot to display (defaults to current time).
|`zoom`|String (Number)|No|Zoom level in minutes (defaults to 60).

=== The Celos Name

The link:http://www.quicksilver899.com/Tolkien/LOTR/LOTR_AC.html[_Lord
of the Rings Dictionary_] defines it as:

....
Celos S; also Kelos; freshet; kel- flow away [Sil; *kelu-]; one would
want to choose los snow [Sil] for the final element, but the text of
Unfinished Tales, Index, entry Celos states the final form derives
from Q -sse, -ssa, a form of emphasis [some say locative], making the
definition 'much flowing' or 'freshet', often resulting from melting
snow; perhaps 'snow' is then implied from the ending; a river in
Gondor
....

Alternatively, the
link:http://programmingisterrible.com/post/65781074112/devils-dictionary-of-programming[_Devil’s
Dictionary of Programming_] defines it as:

....
Configurable: It’s your job to make it usable.
Elegant: The only use case is making me feel smart.
Lightweight: I don’t understand the use-cases the alternatives solve.
Opinionated: I don’t believe that your use case exists.
Simple: It solves my use case.
